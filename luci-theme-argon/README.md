## Notice

- Chrome browser is highly recommended. There are some new css3 features used in this theme, currently only Chrome has the best compatibility.
- Microsoft has officially retired Internet Explorer, RIP IE🙏<del>Currently, the mainline version of the IE series has bugs that need to be addressed.</del>
- FireFox does not enable the backdrop-filter by default, [see here](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) for the opening method.
